My aim has always been to spread Bangladeshi culture as far and as wide as possible. There was never a Bangladeshi presence in my undergrad but that changed in Graduate School. I have been the Vice President of the Bangladesh Student Organization here on campus for 2019-2020, and I host the annual Bangladeshi Cultural Festival, showcasing Bangladeshi cultural heritage to the university as a whole.

I have also been deeply involved in organizations and leadership to help advance social change in whatever direction I think is necessary at the time. I was a Foundation Member of the Libertarian National Committe in undergrad and since 2020 I have been an active member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Since 2022 I have also served as Treasurer for the Graduate Student Colloqium. Our aim has been to meet every week to give expository talks to first, second, and third year students, on things we feel are interesting, our own research areas and things in popular demand.

I am very passionate about teaching and fostering STEM in younger students. I am a 2017, and 2019 participant in the Celebration of Mind (COM) festival held at the Mathematical Sciences Department. This showcases interesting mathematical puzzles to cohorts of students in middle school and below to foster curiosity and enthusiasm for mathematics. In 2024 I am a participant in the Arkansas Math Discovery Day celebration by sponsoring and putting up a booth.

Corollary to that in 2023 and 2024 I was the Lead Judge in the Computer Science category for the Junior and Middle Divisions for the Northwest Arkansas Regional Science and Engineering Fair.
