Found here.\nTurns out none of the commonly available deep learning libraries were doing what I wanted to do with neural networks, i.e. allowing you to do scalar left and right multiplication, composition, addition, raising to a power, exponential, and basic trigonometric functions, and neural network polynomials. So I went ahead and architect-ed an R package for my own needs.\nYou can download this by typing install.packages(\"nnR\") today."

This is an NSF EPSCOR funded workshop aiming to bring promising students from across two dozen different states to provide hands-on experience on real-life machine learning and data science applications.\n\n\n\nMathematical Sciences Research Institute / Simons-Laufer Mathematical Scinces Institute In the summer of 2023 I was honored to participate in the MSRI/SLMath Summer Graduate School on Machine Learning hosted at UC San Diego. Our cohort consisted of students from across the world, including South Korea, Spain, and Togo. Our workshops featured hands on experience with neural networks and lectures on the cutting edge of machine learning, such as overparametrization and adversarial patterns in computer vision.\n\n\n\n\nPosters\n\nMaximal Parameter Estimates for Neural Networks and Uncertainties in Approximation. SIAM Conference on Uncertainty Quantification, Trieste, ItalyWe take a structural description of neural networks first proposed by Peterson and Voightlander, 2019 and further built upon by Grohs et. al, 2020, and further extend this neural network calculus. Along the way we rebuild several bits of well-known machinery in the language of neural networks and show that yes, indeed, parameter estimates are bounded polynomially on the precision of our estimates. We give: 1.Neural network architectures representing Taylor polynomials and \\(e^x\\). 2. Neural network architectures that are able to simulate a highly modified Monte Carlo sampling from Brownian motions along the function support 3. Neural network estimates for trapezoidal rule 4. And finally for the first time, that neural networks without too many (defined as being polynomial on the precision) parameters may be able to approximate a modified diffusion equation. This adds to the literature in that it builds upon a much needed need to formally axiomatize neural networks, both in terms of the number of parameters and exactly how expressive it can be. Minimal parameter estimates mean neural networks will be more accessible in smaller computing devices, meaning greater access for more people to this amazing technology and it means that more efficient neural networks can be built which reduce environmental impact as we march forward into a more artificial intelligence focused age.\nA Census Tract based clustering analysis of ride-shareing behavior or Chicago residents during the era of the pandemic Arkansas Spring Lecture Series 2022, Fayetteville, ARThis a presentation of the work upto that time, on segmenting the customers in ride-sharing apps such as Chicago during the year 2020. Held once a year, the Arkansas Spring Lecture Series is a conference bringing together mathematicians from across the world to present the very latest in their research. The theme this year was data science, and featured among others Dr. Yousef Saad, Dr. Sabine van Huffel and Dr. Jack Dongara. It is funded by the University of Arkansas and the NSF.\nAn analysis of customer behavior in ride-sharing apps during the era of the pandemic SIAM Mathematics of Data Science San Diego, CA We take the work presented earlier in the Arkansas Spring Lecture Series and expand on that. Held every year the Mathematics of Data Science Conference MDS 22 seeks to bring the cutting edge of data science from across the world into one conference. A pre-print can be found here"
