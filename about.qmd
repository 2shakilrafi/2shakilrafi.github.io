I like to travel, and especially to hike and visit National Parks and road trips. Among them I like taking photographs mostly of grass and sky. My Instagram is [\@thatbangladeshidude](https://www.instagram.com/thatbangladeshidude/).

I also like reading, mostly non-fiction, mostly history, and definitely if it involves economics or geopolitics. You can see my bookshelf,

In my spare time I like to cook, run, and (very badly) play the keyboard. Also doing nothing is kind of fun.
